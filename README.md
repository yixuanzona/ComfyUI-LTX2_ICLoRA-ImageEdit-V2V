## About the Files
This contains three ComfyUI workflows. You can run them separately or use the combined workflow:

### I2V + EditImage ###
A combined workflow based on LTX-2_ICLoRA_Distilled pipeline and QwenImageEdit2509. It includes toggle switches to enable or disable steps, or to switch controls within the same workflow:

Step 1. Automatically extracts the first frame from an input video (or uses a provided image). Edits the frame using a reference style/image and prompt.

Step 2. Uses the edited image as input for the LTX-2 section. In the main Subgraph node, select the control type using SelectControl (values 1–3), make sure to select the corresponding LoRA:
 - 1 – Depth
 - 2 – Canny
 - 3 – Pose

### I2V ###
A standalone Image-to-Video workflow using LTX-2_ICLoRA_Distilled. The settings are the same as the I2V part in the combined workflow, without the image editing steps.

### EditImage ###
A standalone workflow for image editing and upscaling. It uses the QwenImageEdit2509 pipeline together with SeedVR2 upscaling.
